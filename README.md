- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JefferyBrown1407.  
I'm a retired astronomer.  I'm here strictly as a consumer, to try getting IRAF and pymoogi downloaded and running on a new Linux machine.  As far as software development goes, I'm a complete n00b, although I've been programming -- strictly applications -- almost exclusively for my own use in fortran, assembly (for a machine that no longer is available), troff, C (and later and C++, though I paid the bills doing that latter for a couple of years), python, and probably some other stuff I've forgotten, since the mid-1970s.
